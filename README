# ICSNPP-PRES

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Connection-Oriented Presentation Protocol (PRES)

## Overview

This plugin provides a protocol analyzer for the OSI Presenation Procol (PRES)
(ISO 8823 / X.226) for use within Zeek. The analyzer enables Zeek to parse
ppdus.

## Dependencies

As PRES is a protocol based on the OSI stack, the underlying ISO
protocol layers must also be processed. The following plugins must therefore
also be installed:

- [TPKT](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-tpkt)
- [COTP](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-iso-cotp)
- [SESS](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-sess)

## Installation

### Package Manager

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html).

```bash
zkg refresh
zkg install pres
```

If this package is installed from ZKG, it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly, users will see `ANALYZER_PRES` under the list of plugins.

If users have ZKG configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and these scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

## Usage

The plugin enables the integration of application protocols based on the OSI stack. For this, the application protocol anaylzer must have the name `util::canonify_name(“ISO:”+oid)` (e.g. `util::canonify_name("ISO:1.0.9506.4")` which results in "ISO_1_0_9506_4").
