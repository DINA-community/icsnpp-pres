# ICSNPP-PRES

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Connection-Oriented Presentation Protocol (PRES)

## Overview

This plugin provides a protocol analyzer for the OSI Presenation Procol (PRES)
(ISO 8823 / X.226) for use within Zeek. The analyzer enables Zeek to parse
ppdus.

## Dependencies

As PRES is a protocol based on the OSI stack, the underlying ISO
protocol layers must also be processed. The following plugins must therefore
also be installed:

- [TPKT](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-tpkt)
- [COTP](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-iso-cotp)
- [SESS](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-sess)

## Installation

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html).

```bash
zkg refresh
zkg install pres
```

If this package is installed from ZKG, it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly, users will see `ANALYZER_PRES` under the list of plugins.

If users have ZKG configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the [ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and these scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

## Logging

One dataset is logged for each pres association containing the following fields. 

| Field             | Type      | Description                                                       |
| ----------------- |-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ts_start          | time      | Timestamp of the first pdu                                        |
| ts_end            | time      | Timestamp of the last pdu                                         |
| uid               | string    | Unique ID for this connection                                     |
| orig_h            | address   | Source IP address                                                 |
| orig_p            | port      | Source port                                                       |
| resp_h            | address   | Destination IP address                                            |
| resp_p            | port      | Destination port                                                  |
| refused           | bool      | true if a CPR ppdu was recieved else otherwise                    |
| refuse_reason     | string    | reason for the refusal if refused is true                         |
| aborted           | bool      | true if a Abort ppdu was recieved else otherwise                  |
| abort_reason      | string    | reason for the abort if aborted is true                           |
| cids              | string    | mapping of the context ids to the object ids in the following form "<CID>:<OID>;..." |
| data_bytes        | count     | total number of bytes send as user data                           |
| data_packets      | count     | total number of pdus containing user data                         |

## Usage

The plugin enables the integration of application protocols based on the OSI stack. For this, the application protocol anaylzer must have the name `util::canonify_name(“ISO:”+oid)` (e.g. `util::canonify_name("ISO:1.0.9506.4")` which results in "ISO_1_0_9506_4").
